    "Easy to Learn and Use:\n",
    "Python has simple words and clear rules. It feels like writing English.\n",

    "Used in Many Areas:\n",
    "You can use Python for websites, data science, machine learning, games, automation, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Community:\n",
    "Many people use Python, so it's easy to find help, guides, and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of Libraries:\n",
    "Python has ready-made tools (called libraries) for almost everything—like maths, AI, web apps, etc.\n",

    "You write Python code in a .py file.\n",

    "The Python interpreter reads the code one line at a time.\n",
